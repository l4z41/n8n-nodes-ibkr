- OHLC data (open, high, low, close)
- Timestamps for updates
- Previous price and change % (for price change mode)

### Example Workflows

#### Place a Market Order

1. Add an Interactive Brokers node
2. Select Resource: **Order**
3. Select Operation: **Place Order**
4. Configure:
   - Symbol: `AAPL`
   - Action: `Buy`
   - Quantity: `100`
   - Order Type: `Market`
   - Exchange: `SMART`
   - Currency: `USD`

#### Get Real-Time Quote

1. Add an Interactive Brokers node
2. Select Resource: **Market Data**
3. Select Operation: **Get Quote**
4. Configure:
   - Symbol: `TSLA`
   - Security Type: `Stock`
   - Exchange: `SMART`
   - Currency: `USD`

#### Automated Trading on Price Changes

1. Add an **Interactive Brokers Trigger** node
2. Configure:
   - Symbol: `AAPL`
   - Trigger On: `Price Change`
   - Minimum Price Change (%): `0.5`
   - Update Interval (Seconds): `10`
3. Add an **IF** node to check price conditions
4. Add an **Interactive Brokers** node to place orders based on conditions

This workflow will automatically execute every 10 seconds when AAPL's price changes by 0.5% or more.

#### Monitor Multiple Stocks with Real-Time Triggers

Create separate workflows for each symbol you want to monitor:
- One workflow with trigger for AAPL
- Another workflow with trigger for TSLA
- Each workflow can have different logic and update intervals

#### Webhook Notifications on Market Events

1. Add an **Interactive Brokers Trigger** node
2. Configure for your desired symbol and trigger conditions
3. Add a **Webhook** node or **Slack/Discord/Email** node to send notifications
4. Activate the workflow

Now you'll receive automatic notifications whenever market conditions are met!

## Important Notes

ï¿½ **Risk Warning**: This node allows you to place real trades. Always test with paper trading first!

### Connection Settings
- Use port 7497 (TWS) or 4002 (Gateway) for paper trading
- Use port 7496 (TWS) or 4001 (Gateway) for live trading
- Each connection requires a unique Client ID
- Ensure TWS/Gateway is running before executing workflows
- API must be enabled in TWS/Gateway settings

### Trigger Node Best Practices
- **Update Interval**: Set to at least 5-10 seconds to avoid excessive workflow executions
- **Testing**: Always test triggers in development mode before activating in production
- **Market Hours**: Triggers only receive data when markets are open
- **Resource Usage**: Each active trigger maintains a connection to TWS/Gateway
- **Multiple Symbols**: Create separate workflows for each symbol you want to monitor
- **Client IDs**: Use different Client IDs for each trigger to avoid connection conflicts
